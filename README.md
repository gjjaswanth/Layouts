# Standard Cell Design Project – SKY130

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents my ongoing work on **CMOS standard cell design using the SKY130 (130nm) PDK**.  
The objective of this project is to understand and implement the complete standard cell design flow from schematic to layout-level verification.

## ✅ Work Completed

- Transistor-level design of:
  - CMOS Inverter (INV)
  - 2-Input NAND Gate
  - 2-Input NOR Gate
- SPICE simulation using NGSPICE
- Physical layout design using Magic
- Design Rule Check (DRC) verification
- Parasitic extraction from layout
- Switch-level functional verification using IRSIM

This work demonstrates understanding of:
- Pull-up and Pull-down network design
- CMOS logic implementation
- Layout design rules (130nm)
- Basic ASIC standard cell development flow
